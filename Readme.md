# **QuantityMeasurementApp**

## Overview

This repository documents the daily progress of tasks completed during the BridgeLabz Training Program.

The project focuses on building a **Quantity Measurement Application using Java**, following **clean coding principles, Object-Oriented Design, and Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

The application evolves step-by-step from basic equality checks to a **full Spring Boot application with database integration**.
